### 🔹 Networking & Community

Had the privilege of meeting **legendary Postgres contributors** and reconnecting with colleagues. The best part? Engaging in live discussions at sessions, booths, and even over lunch! Nothing beats in-person interactions. 🤝

### 🔹 Key Takeaways

- ✅ Hands-on training on **building RAG applications** leveraging **pgVector** & optimizing vector searches
- ✅ Understanding **Throughput vs Recall** in vector search to balance cost vs performance
- ✅ Advanced **Postgres monitoring** with pgWatch 🔍

### 🎤 𝗛𝗼𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗳𝘂𝗹𝗹 𝗖𝗹𝗼𝘂𝗱𝗡𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗣𝗚 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴!
